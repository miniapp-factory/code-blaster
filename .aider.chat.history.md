```
You pilot a sleek, futuristic star-fighter tearing through a digital universe corrupted by rogue code. The only weapon you’ve got? Your typing skills.

Enemies aren’t just ships — they’re bug clusters, glitch swarms, and malicious programs floating in your path. To fire, you have to type the code fragment hovering above each enemy. The code evolves as you progress:

Beginner: simple Java commands, print statements, basic variables

Intermediate: loops, conditionals, arrays

Advanced: method calls, class definitions, debugging broken snippets

Expert: multi-line sequences, real algorithm fragments, rapid-swap code challenges

Every word you nail = a laser blast. Every full snippet = a combo strike.

Why it hits different

Dynamic Waves: Enemies don’t just fly at you — they move in patterns tied to the rhythm of your typing speed. Type slow? They close in. Type fast? You push the swarm back.

Typing “Power-Ups”:

Perfect Typist: type 10 lines without error → unleash an auto-turret for 5 seconds

Syntax Surge: completing a long snippet triggers a screen-wide code-burst

Bug Fixer: typing a corrected version of a broken snippet clears the whole lane

Boss Battles: Massive AI constructs with health bars made of multi-step code puzzles.

Stage 1: fix syntax

Stage 2: fill in missing logic

Stage 3: type flawless speed bursts

Difficulty Modes:

Casual: forgiving typos, slower enemies

Standard: balanced speed + accuracy

Hardcore: zero-error mode with enemy projectiles

Insanity: snippets are full mini-functions + bullet-hell patterns

Progression System:
Earn XP to unlock new ships with passive buffs:

Faster “cooldown” between typing shots

Auto-correct shields

Slow-time ability triggered after a perfect line

Visual Style:
Retro-future neon mixed with glitchy cyber aesthetics. Every time you type, your ship pulses with code-energy.

The vibe

It’s not just a typing game.
It’s not just a shooter.
It’s a skill-grind coding adventure that actually makes you better at programming while shredding through waves of glitch monsters.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A sleek starfighter silhouette in neon blue and pink, hovering over a digital battlefield of glitchy code fragments. The background is a dark gradient with floating binary patterns. The starfighter emits a glowing trail of code lines, giving a sense of motion and typing power. The overall aesthetic is retro‑future neon with glitch effects.
