```
You pilot a sleek, futuristic star-fighter tearing through a digital universe corrupted by rogue code. The only weapon you’ve got? Your typing skills.

Enemies aren’t just ships — they’re bug clusters, glitch swarms, and malicious programs floating in your path. To fire, you have to type the code fragment hovering above each enemy. The code evolves as you progress:

Beginner: simple Java commands, print statements, basic variables

Intermediate: loops, conditionals, arrays

Advanced: method calls, class definitions, debugging broken snippets

Expert: multi-line sequences, real algorithm fragments, rapid-swap code challenges

Every word you nail = a laser blast. Every full snippet = a combo strike.

Why it hits different

Dynamic Waves: Enemies don’t just fly at you — they move in patterns tied to the rhythm of your typing speed. Type slow? They close in. Type fast? You push the swarm back.

Typing “Power-Ups”:

Perfect Typist: type 10 lines without error → unleash an auto-turret for 5 seconds

Syntax Surge: completing a long snippet triggers a screen-wide code-burst

Bug Fixer: typing a corrected version of a broken snippet clears the whole lane

Boss Battles: Massive AI constructs with health bars made of multi-step code puzzles.

Stage 1: fix syntax

Stage 2: fill in missing logic

Stage 3: type flawless speed bursts

Difficulty Modes:

Casual: forgiving typos, slower enemies

Standard: balanced speed + accuracy

Hardcore: zero-error mode with enemy projectiles

Insanity: snippets are full mini-functions + bullet-hell patterns

Progression System:
Earn XP to unlock new ships with passive buffs:

Faster “cooldown” between typing shots

Auto-correct shields

Slow-time ability triggered after a perfect line

Visual Style:
Retro-future neon mixed with glitchy cyber aesthetics. Every time you type, your ship pulses with code-energy.

The vibe

It’s not just a typing game.
It’s not just a shooter.
It’s a skill-grind coding adventure that actually makes you better at programming while shredding through waves of glitch monsters.

Level-by-Level Description
Level 1 — Boot Sector

Theme: Clean neon grid, simple moving enemies

Enemies:
Syntax Mites: hover slowly, short code snippets like System.out.println("Hello");

Code Difficulty: Very easy, single-line snippets

Goal: Teach the typing-shoot mechanic

Power-ups: Basic “Syntax Surge” after 2 perfect snippets

Level 2 — Firewall Range

Theme: Warm red-orange tones, moving firewall barriers

Enemies:

Loop Crawlers: require typing simple loops

Syntax Mites: faster than Level 1

Code Difficulty: 1–2 line snippets, basic loops and variables

Goal: Introduce timing with moving enemies

Power-ups: “Code Shield” triggers after a long snippet

Level 3 — Data Abyss

Theme: Dark, glitchy environment with moving digital fragments

Enemies:

Null Swarms: fast, break combo if not typed quickly

Overflowers: spawn in clusters, require multiple correct typings

Code Difficulty: 2–3 line snippets, conditionals, arrays

Goal: Introduce combo mechanics, teach typing under pressure

Power-ups: Autocoder unlocks temporarily for error correction

Level 4 — Malware Metropolis

Theme: Neon city filled with corrupted skyscrapers, bullet patterns

Enemies:

Loop Crawlers + Overflowers combined

Syntax Mites spawn from above

Code Difficulty: Medium multi-line snippets, small logic challenges

Goal: Teach rapid multi-target typing and strategic power-up usage

Power-ups: Debugger Drone spawns when typing perfect streaks

Level 5 — Kernel Core (Boss Level)

Theme: Mega central AI core, intense visuals, high danger

Boss: MEGA-GLITCH KAIROS

Stage 1: fix broken syntax to stabilize ship

Stage 2: fill missing logic under enemy fire

Stage 3: multi-line snippet combos under pressure, bullet-hell patterns

Code Difficulty: Advanced multi-line snippets, algorithm fragments

Goal: Test all skills learned so far, introduce complex combos

Power-ups: All available power-ups can appear, max combo multiplier possible

Level 6+ (Endless or Campaign Progression)

Theme: Alternate environments like Cyber Jungle, Quantum Data Stream, Virus Lab

Enemies: All previous types + elite boss mini-bosses

Code Difficulty: Gradually increases with long snippets, recursion, real debugging tasks

Goal: Continuous progression for hardcore players or endless mode for leaderboard competition

Gameplay Flow Summary

Home Screen → Start Game

Level 1 → type basic snippets → blast Syntax Mites

After completing each level → Next Level button → jump straight to next stage

Power-ups and combos become progressively more essential

Boss levels (every 5 stages) combine typing challenges + bullet-hell patterns

Endless Mode or higher campaign levels keep introducing tougher snippets, faster enemies, and multi-tasking typing challenges

Ah, got it — we’re talking mini-game scale, not a full campaign-style game. That actually makes it simpler and cleaner. Here’s the revised, concise version optimized for a mini-game format:

Code Striker: Syntax Squadron — Mini-Game Version
Home Screen

Big central “Start Game” button

Minimal UI, neon/cyber background with subtle moving code fragments

Tap/click → immediately starts Level 1

Gameplay

You control a spaceship flying forward automatically.

Enemies appear in front of you with code snippets above them.

To shoot: type the code snippet correctly.

Correct typing = instant laser attack on the enemy.

Mistyped letters = small delay before you can type again.

Level Flow

Mini-game has 3–5 short levels, each lasting ~1–2 minutes:

Level 1 — Boot Sector

Theme: Clean neon grid

Enemies: Syntax Mites (short snippets, e.g., System.out.println("Hi");)

Goal: Teach typing-to-shoot mechanic

Power-ups: Small “Syntax Surge” after 2 perfect snippets

Level 2 — Firewall Range

Theme: Red/orange cyber walls

Enemies: Loop Crawlers (short loops), faster Syntax Mites

Goal: Introduce moving targets + slightly longer snippets

Power-ups: “Code Shield” after long snippet

Level 3 — Data Abyss

Theme: Dark glitchy visuals

Enemies: Null Swarms (fast, break combos), Overflowers (cluster spawn)

Goal: Test combo + speed typing

Power-ups: Temporary Autocoder for minor errors

Level 4 — Malware Metropolis

Theme: Neon cyber city

Enemies: Combined previous types

Goal: Introduce multi-target typing + mid-level pressure

Power-ups: Debugger Drone auto-attacks weak enemies

Level 5 — Kernel Core (Boss Level)

Theme: AI core, intense visuals

Boss: MEGA-GLITCH KAIROS

Stage 1: fix broken syntax

Stage 2: fill missing logic while dodging bullets

Stage 3: multi-line snippet combo under timed pressure

####   
#### Mini-game has 3–5 short levels, each lasting ~1–2 minutes:  
####   
#### Level 1 — Boot Sector  
####   
#### Theme: Clean neon grid  
####   
#### Enemies: Syntax Mites (short snippets, e.g., System.out.println("Hi");)  
####   
#### Goal: Teach typing-to-shoot mechanic  
####   
#### Power-ups: Small “Syntax Surge” after 2 perfect snippets  
####   
#### Level 2 — Firewall Range  
####   
#### Theme: Red/orange cyber walls  
####   
#### Enemies: Loop Crawlers (short loops), faster Syntax Mites  
####   
#### Goal: Introduce moving targets + slightly longer snippets  
####   
#### Power-ups: “Code Shield” after long snippet  
####   
#### Level 3 — Data Abyss  
####   
#### Theme: Dark glitchy visuals  
####   
#### Enemies: Null Swarms (fast, break combos), Overflowers (cluster spawn)  
####   
#### Goal: Test combo + speed typing  
####   
#### Power-ups: Temporary Autocoder for minor errors  
####   
#### Level 4 — Malware Metropolis  
####   
#### Theme: Neon cyber city  
####   
#### Enemies: Combined previous types  
####   
#### Goal: Introduce multi-target typing + mid-level pressure  
####   
#### Power-ups: Debugger Drone auto-attacks weak enemies  
####   
#### Level 5 — Kernel Core (Boss Level)  
####   
#### Theme: AI core, intense visuals  
####   
#### Boss: MEGA-GLITCH KAIROS  
####   
#### Stage 1: fix broken syntax  
####   
#### Stage 2: fill missing logic while dodging bullets  
####   
#### Stage 3: multi-line snippet combo under timed pressure  
####   
#### Goal: Full mini-game finale, all skills tested  
####   
#### After Each Level  
####   
#### Show “Next Level” button  
####   
#### Tap/click → move immediately to next level  
####   
#### Keeps gameplay flowing — no returning to home screen  
####   
#### Mini-Game Features  
####   
#### Short, focused gameplay (1–2 min per level)  
####   
#### Quick typing-to-shoot mechanic  
####   
#### Increasing snippet complexity  
####   
#### Combo/power-up mechanics to reward skillful typing  
####   
#### Visual feedback: lasers, screen shakes, flashy effects on correct typing  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited (or created) to implement the requested home‑screen, level flow, and navigation logic:

- `mini-app/app/page.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/start-button.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/next-level-button.tsx` (new file)  
- `mini-app/app/level-1/page.tsx`  
- `mini-app/app/level-2/page.tsx`  
- `mini-app/app/level-3/page.tsx`  
- `mini-app/app/level-4/page.tsx`  
- `mini-app/app/level-5/page.tsx`  
- `mini-app/app/level-6/page.tsx` (if you want an endless or campaign level)  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I see you’ve added the three files you mentioned.  
To fully support the “Start Game” → “Level 1” → “Next Level” flow, you’ll also need:

1. A **NextLevelButton** component that navigates to the next level.  
2. Pages for the subsequent levels (e.g., `mini-app/app/level-2/page.tsx`, `mini-app/app/level-3/page.tsx`, etc.) that render the level content and include the `NextLevelButton`.

Could you confirm which level pages you’d like to create (e.g., up to level 5) and whether you’d like a reusable `NextLevelButton` component? Once you add those files to the chat, I’ll provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Could you please provide the current (original) contents of the following files so I can create accurate *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them?

- `mini-app/app/level-1/page.tsx`
- `mini-app/app/level-2/page.tsx`

#### in every level put an jet that fires the bugs, but to shoot the user need to type an basic coding in the game gives  

The changes you’re describing will need to touch the level pages themselves (and possibly a new component for the jet).  
The files that will most likely need to be edited are:

```
mini-app/app/level-1/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-2/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-3/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-4/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-5/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-6/page.tsx
```

If you want a reusable “Jet” component that handles the shooting logic, you could also add:

```
mini-app/components/jet.tsx
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

#### make an ship shape that move and shoot and put an indicator what code to type so the user can score and shoot his ship  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement a moving, shooting ship with a code‑typing indicator:

```
mini-app/components/jet.tsx
mini-app/components/ship.tsx
mini-app/components/code-indicator.tsx
mini-app/app/level-1/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-2/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-3/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-4/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-5/page.tsx
mini-app/app/level-6/page.tsx
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
