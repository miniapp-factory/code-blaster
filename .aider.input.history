+Code the following app
+```
+You pilot a sleek, futuristic star-fighter tearing through a digital universe corrupted by rogue code. The only weapon you’ve got? Your typing skills.
+
+Enemies aren’t just ships — they’re bug clusters, glitch swarms, and malicious programs floating in your path. To fire, you have to type the code fragment hovering above each enemy. The code evolves as you progress:
+
+Beginner: simple Java commands, print statements, basic variables
+
+Intermediate: loops, conditionals, arrays
+
+Advanced: method calls, class definitions, debugging broken snippets
+
+Expert: multi-line sequences, real algorithm fragments, rapid-swap code challenges
+
+Every word you nail = a laser blast. Every full snippet = a combo strike.
+
+Why it hits different
+
+Dynamic Waves: Enemies don’t just fly at you — they move in patterns tied to the rhythm of your typing speed. Type slow? They close in. Type fast? You push the swarm back.
+
+Typing “Power-Ups”:
+
+Perfect Typist: type 10 lines without error → unleash an auto-turret for 5 seconds
+
+Syntax Surge: completing a long snippet triggers a screen-wide code-burst
+
+Bug Fixer: typing a corrected version of a broken snippet clears the whole lane
+
+Boss Battles: Massive AI constructs with health bars made of multi-step code puzzles.
+
+Stage 1: fix syntax
+
+Stage 2: fill in missing logic
+
+Stage 3: type flawless speed bursts
+
+Difficulty Modes:
+
+Casual: forgiving typos, slower enemies
+
+Standard: balanced speed + accuracy
+
+Hardcore: zero-error mode with enemy projectiles
+
+Insanity: snippets are full mini-functions + bullet-hell patterns
+
+Progression System:
+Earn XP to unlock new ships with passive buffs:
+
+Faster “cooldown” between typing shots
+
+Auto-correct shields
+
+Slow-time ability triggered after a perfect line
+
+Visual Style:
+Retro-future neon mixed with glitchy cyber aesthetics. Every time you type, your ship pulses with code-energy.
+
+The vibe
+
+It’s not just a typing game.
+It’s not just a shooter.
+It’s a skill-grind coding adventure that actually makes you better at programming while shredding through waves of glitch monsters.

+Power-ups: Basic “Syntax Surge” after 2 perfect snippets
+
+Level 2 — Firewall Range
+
+Theme: Warm red-orange tones, moving firewall barriers
+
+Enemies:

+
+Gameplay Flow Summary
+
+Home Screen → Start Game
+
+Level 1 → type basic snippets → blast Syntax Mites
+
+After completing each level → Next Level button → jump straight to next stage
+
+Power-ups and combos become progressively more essential
+
+Boss levels (every 5 stages) combine typing challenges + bullet-hell patterns
+
+Endless Mode or higher campaign levels keep introducing tougher snippets, faster enemies, and multi-tasking typing challenges
+
+Ah, got it — we’re talking mini-game scale, not a full campaign-style game. That actually makes it simpler and cleaner. Here’s the revised, concise version optimized for a mini-game format:
+
+Code Striker: Syntax Squadron — Mini-Game Version
+Home Screen
+
+Big central “Start Game” button
+
+Minimal UI, neon/cyber background with subtle moving code fragments

+Tap/click → immediately starts Level 1
+
+Gameplay
+
+You control a spaceship flying forward automatically.
+
+Enemies appear in front of you with code snippets above them.
