+Code the following app
+```
+You pilot a sleek, futuristic star-fighter tearing through a digital universe corrupted by rogue code. The only weapon you’ve got? Your typing skills.
+
+Enemies aren’t just ships — they’re bug clusters, glitch swarms, and malicious programs floating in your path. To fire, you have to type the code fragment hovering above each enemy. The code evolves as you progress:
+
+Beginner: simple Java commands, print statements, basic variables
+
+Intermediate: loops, conditionals, arrays
+
+Advanced: method calls, class definitions, debugging broken snippets
+
+Expert: multi-line sequences, real algorithm fragments, rapid-swap code challenges
+
+Every word you nail = a laser blast. Every full snippet = a combo strike.
+
+Why it hits different
+
+Dynamic Waves: Enemies don’t just fly at you — they move in patterns tied to the rhythm of your typing speed. Type slow? They close in. Type fast? You push the swarm back.
+
+Typing “Power-Ups”:
+
+Perfect Typist: type 10 lines without error → unleash an auto-turret for 5 seconds
+
+Syntax Surge: completing a long snippet triggers a screen-wide code-burst
+
+Bug Fixer: typing a corrected version of a broken snippet clears the whole lane
+
+Boss Battles: Massive AI constructs with health bars made of multi-step code puzzles.
+
+Stage 1: fix syntax
+
+Stage 2: fill in missing logic
+
+Stage 3: type flawless speed bursts
+
+Difficulty Modes:
+
+Casual: forgiving typos, slower enemies
+
+Standard: balanced speed + accuracy
+
+Hardcore: zero-error mode with enemy projectiles
+
+Insanity: snippets are full mini-functions + bullet-hell patterns
+
+Progression System:
+Earn XP to unlock new ships with passive buffs:
+
+Faster “cooldown” between typing shots
+
+Auto-correct shields
+
+Slow-time ability triggered after a perfect line
+
+Visual Style:
+Retro-future neon mixed with glitchy cyber aesthetics. Every time you type, your ship pulses with code-energy.
+
+The vibe
+
+It’s not just a typing game.
+It’s not just a shooter.
+It’s a skill-grind coding adventure that actually makes you better at programming while shredding through waves of glitch monsters.
